## Functional Requirements
The organization intends to use its own infrastructure to maintain control over user data and costs.

To support this initiative, they will acquire an AI workstation costing around $10,000–$15,000. The system will serve 300 students, all of whom reside in Dubai.

## Assumptions
An open-source model such as DeepSeek R1 will be selected. The chosen language model must be efficient enough to operate within the allocated hardware budget.
A dedicated server will be deployed either in the office or in the company’s cloud infrastructure.

## Data Strategy
To mitigate intellectual property risks, the organization will procure licensed content or use data that is not subject to copyright restrictions.

## Considerations
Several open-source models are being evaluated, including Llama 2 (Meta), Mistral 7B, and IBM Granite, which offers traceable training data for legal compliance.
